# Home Assistant App: CHIP Tool

The CHIP Tool app provides the Matter chip-tool controller directly in Home Assistant.

It is intended for Matter development, testing, debugging, and advanced troubleshooting. The app gives you access to the chip-tool command line through Home Assistant, without having to build and install the Matter CHIP Tool separately.

Note: This app is currently experimental and is intended primarily for advanced users.

## What is CHIP Tool?

chip-tool is a Matter controller. It can be used to:

- commission Matter devices;
- communicate with commissioned Matter devices;
- read and write Matter attributes;
- send Matter commands;
- subscribe to Matter attributes and events;
- test and troubleshoot Matter devices.

The CHIP Tool itself is part of the Matter SDK. The Home Assistant app provides a convenient way to run it from your Home Assistant system. For a complete reference, see the Matter project's [Working with the CHIP Tool][chip_tool_guide] documentation.

## Installation

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the app page in your Home Assistant instance.

   [![Open this app in your Home Assistant instance.][app-badge]][app]

2. If this is the first app you install from the `apps-development` repository, Home Assistant will ask you to add the repository. Click **Add**.
3. Click **Install** to install the app.
4. Start the app once the installation is complete.

## Using CHIP Tool

After starting the app, open CHIP Tool from the Home Assistant sidebar.

The app provides a terminal where you can run chip-tool commands.

To display the available commands, run:

```
chip-tool
```

chip-tool displays the available command groups and options. You can use these commands to discover the functionality supported by the installed version of the Matter SDK.

For example, to see the commands available for the `onoff` cluster:

```
chip-tool onoff
```

To see the available options for a specific command:

```
chip-tool onoff on
```

### Commissioning a Matter device

Before you can control a Matter device with chip-tool, the device must be commissioned.

For example, if you have a Matter QR code or manual pairing code, you can use:

```
chip-tool pairing code <node_id> <qr_code_or_manual_code>
```

For example:

```
chip-tool pairing code 1 MT:Y.K9042C00KA0648G00
```

Where:

- `<node_id>` is the ID you assign to the Matter device.
- `<qr_code_or_manual_code>` is the QR code payload or manual pairing code from the device.

Other commissioning methods are available for different network configurations, including Wi-Fi, Thread, and commissioning through a proxy.

For detailed commissioning instructions, see the Matter [Working with the CHIP Tool][chip_tool_guide] documentation.

### Controlling a Matter device

Once a device has been commissioned, you can use chip-tool to interact with the Matter clusters implemented by the device.

For example, a device implementing the On/Off cluster can be controlled with:

```
chip-tool onoff on <node_id> <endpoint_id>
```

To turn it off:

```
chip-tool onoff off <node_id> <endpoint_id>
```

To read the current On/Off state:

```
chip-tool onoff read on-off <node_id> <endpoint_id>
```

The exact commands available depend on the device type and the Matter clusters implemented by the device.

### Finding commands and options

chip-tool contains a large number of Matter commands. You can use the command line itself to discover what is available.

List all top-level commands:

```
chip-tool
```

List the commands available for a cluster:

```
chip-tool <cluster>
```

For example:

```
chip-tool onoff
```

List the options for a command:

```
chip-tool onoff on
```

This is often the easiest way to determine the parameters required by a command. You can also run the command without all its arguments to display the expected parameters.

For the complete list of supported commands, options, interactive mode, subscriptions, and advanced features, see the Matter [Working with the CHIP Tool][chip_tool_guide] documentation.

## Matter applications and tools

The Matter SDK contains many applications and development tools. Their names can be confusing at first because not all of them are controllers.

The important distinction is:

- **chip-tool** is the Matter controller. It is used to commission and control Matter devices.
- The other applications are Matter examples. They implement different device types or services and are mainly intended for development and testing.

### Controller and development tools

| Application | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `chip-tool` | Matter controller for commissioning and controlling devices |
| `chip-cert` | Matter certificate and certification tool |

### Device examples

| Application | Device type |
| --- | --- |
| `chip-air-purifier-app` | Air purifier |
| `contact-sensor-app` | Contact sensor |
| `chip-dishwasher-app` | Dishwasher |
| `chip-lighting-app` | Light |
| `chip-lock-app` | Door lock |
| `chip-microwave-oven-app` | Microwave oven |
| `chip-refrigerator-app` | Refrigerator |
| `chip-rvc-app` | Robotic vacuum cleaner |
| `chip-tv-app` | TV application |
| `chip-tv-casting-app` | TV Casting application |
| `matter-water-heater-app` | Water heater |
| `water-leak-detector-app` | Water leak detector |

### Energy and network examples

| Application | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `chip-energy-gateway-app` | Electrical energy pricing and grid conditions |
| `chip-evse-app` | Electric vehicle supply equipment |
| `matter-network-manager-app` | Thread network manager |

### OTA examples

| Application | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `chip-ota-provider-app` | Provides over-the-air firmware updates |
| `chip-ota-requestor-app` | Requests over-the-air firmware updates |

### Commissioning example

| Application | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `chip-terms-and-conditions-app` | Demonstrates terms and conditions during commissioning |

These example applications are bundled directly in the CHIP Tool app's container alongside `chip-tool`. You can run any of them to have a local Matter device to commission and control with `chip-tool`, without needing separate hardware.

## Configuration

This app currently has no configuration options.

## Troubleshooting

### A command fails

Start by checking the command syntax:

```
chip-tool <command>
```

Make sure that:

- the Matter device is powered on and reachable;
- the device has been commissioned when the command requires an existing Matter session;
- the node ID is correct;
- the endpoint ID is correct;
- the command is supported by the device.

### I need to commission a device

The commissioning process depends on the device's network and the commissioning method being used. The Matter CHIP Tool documentation covers commissioning over:

- Bluetooth LE;
- Wi-Fi;
- Thread;
- IP;
- a commissioning proxy.

See the [Working with the CHIP Tool][chip_tool_guide] documentation for the complete procedure.

### I need advanced CHIP Tool features

The Matter documentation also covers:

- single-command and interactive modes;
- reading and writing attributes;
- subscribing to attributes and events;
- testing Matter devices;
- multi-admin scenarios;
- wildcard commands;
- advanced command options.
